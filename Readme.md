This is the ReadMe for the game application called Hill Billies Barn.

It'll give you perspective on what farmers and hopefully learn you a little!

It's fun, you'll love it and please any comments e-mail for additions!

Or contribute with us :)

The purpose of this game is to get you into the real country for a while and see what it's like to be a farmer for a little while (well at least virtually). 

In real life every bail weighs between 70 to 100 pounds depending on how dry the hay is. These are really just the small square hay bails. The bigger square bails and round bails weigh hundreds of pounds, and therefore don't fit into the hay loft.

So we use the tractor for them.

But for the thousands of bails that are produced each season, farmers need to get these bails into the hay loft with an elevator (google bail escalator if you don't know what it is) and once the bails are in the loft, you have to manually (yes by hand) stack the bails to top of the barn.

Here's how you stack:
Ground stackin' is cuttin' side up.
Layers after that are farmers analyzing the best space for each bail to use 100% of the available space to put as many bails into the loft as possible.

City Slicker Translation:
First layer of the bails is set on their sides with the grass vertical and rotated 180 degrees to it's cutting with the bail perpendicular to the barn loft floor.
Second step, use your tetrisy puzzle finger skills to move these bails to the space you want because you probably never threw a real bail in your life (love you all!).

Next give this a shot and become a real bail thrower!
